      <h2>PREPARED</h2>
      <p>We offer an ever-changing assortment of inspired salads, seasonal vegetables, and satisfying proteins thoughtfully prepared for you to take home to family and friends. See what’s cooking in the Rosewater kitchen this week.</p>

      <h2>BAKED FRESH</h2>
      <p>All of our pastries, cookies and other sweet treats are baked from scratch daily in the Rosewater kitchen. Same goes for our sandwich breads and the fresh-baked loaves we offer for sale daily.</p>

      <h2>COFFEE &amp; BEVERAGES</h2>
      <p>We proudly serve our own Rosewater House Blend coffee, roasted especially for us by our up-island friends at Chilmark Coffee. Add to that hot tea, fresh juices, natural sodas and of course our fully stocked Rosewater Market, and we should have a drink to satisfy every thirst.</p>
